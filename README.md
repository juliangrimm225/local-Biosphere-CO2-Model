# local-Biosphere-CO2-Model
The goal is to create a (if possible) deterministic & as simple as possible model to predict the CO2-Production (& Respiration) cycle of a full day in a very local (~few kilometers) area depending mostly on physical data like solar intensity, wind and time of the year.

The "meta goal" or the reason why this is of interest is that once one can model the CO2-Production cylce reasonably well, one will be able to read for example human influence on local CO2-levels and seperate that influence in the data from the natural CO2 fluctuations.
